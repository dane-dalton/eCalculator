# eCalculator Web App

This is my solution to The Odin Project's calculator challenge. With the slow buildup of projects and exercises, I feel confident in my ability to complete this. I am excited for this project, as my DOM manipulation will be tested.

There is going to be a lot of variables moving around and I expect that to be a challenge at first, but with each project my understanding of variable scopes becomes stronger.

## Challenges along the way
-Managing my global current and previous variables are at a given stage of calculation could be handled better in the future. I ended up doing a lot of scrolling up and down to double check them and that can be managed better

-Writing cleaner code for readability. I feel as though I have made a lot of improvements, but there is always room for more. Making a calculator class with calculating methods called by button presses would have resulted in easier to read code

## Personal notes
-Figure out text scaling and the app should scale to mobile

-Adding comments to cut up sections of css is really helping a lot for finding things. In the future, it would be even better to just make more css files and import them to a main file

## Resources used
- coolers.co for my color scheme saved a lot of time on color choices

- dafont.com for my font

- transfonter.org for font file conversion and css file to go along with it
