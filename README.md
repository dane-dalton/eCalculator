# eCalculator Web App

This is my solution to The Odin Project's calculator challenge. With the slow buildup of projects and exercises, I feel confident in my ability to complete this. I am excited for this project, as my DOM manipulation will be tested.

There is going to be a lot of variables moving around and I expect that to be a challenge at first, but with each project my understanding of variable scopes becomes stronger.

## Challenges along the way

## Personal notes
-Figure out text scaling and the app should scale to mobile

-Adding comments to cut up sections of css is really helping a lot for finding things. In the future, it would be even better to just make more css files and import them to a main file

## Resources used
- coolers.co for my color scheme saved a lot of time on color choices

- dafont.com for my font

- transfonter.org for font file conversion and css file to go along with it
