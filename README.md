# eCalculator Web App

This is my solution to The Odin Project's calculator challenge. With the slow buildup of projects and exercises, I feel confident in my ability to complete this. I am excited for this project, as my DOM manipulation will be tested.

There is going to be a lot of variables moving around and I expect that to be a challenge at first, but with each project my understanding of variable scopes becomes stronger.
